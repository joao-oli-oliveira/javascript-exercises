1) loop through your array 
2) for each element of that array find the position of your target element to remove (if it exists) 
3) with the help of the position remove the said element 
4) return the final array

return early 
    Ignoring no present values
    Ignoring if same type is not in array

search -> provide the index position
    toLower
    trim
    types

remove <- based on search index position

how to deal with multiple optional arguments.
